# NRD Lists – Block Newly Registered Domains

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer: NRD Lists Are NOT Suitable for Production Use ⚠️
```diff
- These lists definitely contain false positives, including domains older than 14 or 30 days.  
- They are created as a personal hobby project, without access to commercial WHOIS or registrar APIs.
- Use at your own risk and for research/testing purposes only!
